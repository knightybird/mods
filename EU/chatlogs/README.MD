**Using a Virtual Machine to Run the Client**

The program checks whether the VM_FILE_PATH for chat.log
exists; if it does not, it assumes that the application is running on a personal computer (PC).


**Virtual Machine Functionality**

The VM monitors chat.log, filtering and splitting the content into different files, such as Rookie Chat, Trade Channel, Local Chat, etc.



**Shared chat log**

The VM makes a copy of the chat.log into a shared folder.
Updating every 5 seconds for new entries.

**PC**
 
The PC views the shared chat log.
